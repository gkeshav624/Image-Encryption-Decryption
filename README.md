# Image-Encryption-Decryption
This is a simple web-based project that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using the Triple DES (3DES) encryption algorithm. It uses crypto-js for encryption/decryption and FileSaver.js for downloading files directly from the browser.

# 🛡️ Image Encryption & Decryption using Triple DES

A simple and secure web application for encrypting and decrypting image files using the **Triple DES (3DES)** algorithm. This project is fully client-side and does not require any backend server.

## 📌 Overview

This tool allows users to:
- Encrypt an image file into a secure text format.
- Decrypt the encrypted text back into the original image.
- Use a **secret key** to perform encryption/decryption using `crypto-js`.
- Download encrypted and decrypted files directly from the browser.
